# Introduction
## Fetch data in React using Axios/Fetch and how to advance it to use React Query module

![Fetch Illustration](/modul-3/images/a3.jpg) 

React is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. One common task in React applications is fetching data from a server or API. Axios and Fetch are two commonly used libraries for making HTTP requests in React applications.

In this module, we will start by covering the basics of fetching data with Axios/Fetch. We will cover how to make GET requests to an API endpoint, how to handle data in the component state, and how to handle errors and loading states. We will also cover best practices for using Axios/Fetch in a React application.

After that, we will move on to using React Query, a popular library for managing data fetching in React applications. We will cover the benefits of using React Query and how to install and set it up in a project. We will also cover how to use React Query to fetch data, handle data in the cache, and configure options for pagination and caching.

Finally, we will compare and contrast the two approaches and discuss when to use each one. We will also cover how to integrate React Query with an existing Axios/Fetch codebase and how to migrate from Axios/Fetch to React Query. By the end of this module, you will have a solid understanding of how to fetch data in a React application and how to choose the right approach for your project.
